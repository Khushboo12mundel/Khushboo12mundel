# Khushboo's Robotics and Embedded Systems Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I am a student with a passion for robotics and embedded systems, and this portfolio showcases some of my best work in these fields.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a degree in ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS at MBMU . Throughout my academic career, I have taken courses in embedded systems and robotics, and I have participated in many such workshops. 

## Projects

In this portfolio, you'll find a collection of my robotics and embedded systems projects. These include:

- Line Following RoboT : Line Follower Robot is able to track a line with the help of an IR sensor.
            This sensor has a IR Transmitter and IR receiver. 
            The IR transmitter (IR LED) transmits the light and the Receiver (Photodiode) waits for the transmitted light to
             return back. 
- Gripping bot : i had build a manually controlled gripper bot (wired or wireless) which can
            grip objects and put them in target zones while overcoming the hurdles in the path with minimum time.
             The bot was must be controlled manually. 
- Automatic room lighting : The PIR Motion Sensor Switch can detect the Infrared Rays released by human body. 
          The light or any other electrical appliance can be activated automatically by the active presence of a human 
          body within the detection 
          range / coverage area & when there is no presence the light will be deactivated automatically. 

Each project includes a description, images, and links to relevant code and documentation.

## Skills
